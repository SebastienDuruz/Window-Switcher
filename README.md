# Window Switcher

**Window Switcher** is an **open-source** application that enables users to display **live previews** of selected open windows, with the ability to move, resize, and click to focus windows.

It offers a flexible configuration system based on **prefix-based filters and blacklists**, allowing precise control over which windows are displayed.

This software is inspired by [**eve-o-preview**](https://github.com/EveOPlus/eve-o-preview), but designed for a broader range of use cases.
The primary goal is to provide an **easy and efficient way to multibox** different game clients.

This software **doesn't modify game clients**.
